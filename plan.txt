n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Program will be made in Python for its dictionary.

All numbers from 1-1000000 will be scored on chain length of their Collatz sequence.

When a number is scored, the number and its score are put on the dictionary.

If a number in the dictionary appears in a sequence, use the number and its pre-existing score to save on computing time.

Actually, the next number in a sequence should be scored seperately as well.

Make a recursive function.

Maybe even start from 1000000 to get the most recursion possible, and then go down.

Finally, check for the highest-scored number.
